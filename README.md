# Docker - quanTIseq
Docker image with quanTIseq installed

The quanTIseq tool is designed to estimate the proportional abundance of
lymphocyte cell types from bulk RNA sequencing data. The tool can be run
from either FASTQ files (paired- or single-end) or from a TSV with the
gene expression levels for a collection of samples.

Full documentation for the quanTIseq tool can be found here:
